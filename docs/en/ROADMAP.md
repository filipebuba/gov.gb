# Roadmap


This roadmap organizes upcoming **GOV-GB** deliveries by time horizon. Exact dates may change based on technical and institutional validation.

### Short Term (0-3 months)

- Consolidate institutional landing and project narrative.
- Improve translation coverage (`pt`, `en`, `kr`, `fr`).
- Refine demo flows for `NHA`, `ussd`, and `dashboard`.
- Standardize core documentation (`README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`, `GOVERNANCE`).

### Mid Term (3-6 months)

- Stronger Supabase integration (data and audit readiness).
- Better observability and operational metrics.
- Security hardening (validation, access controls, logging).
- Expanded testing (unit and critical-flow coverage).

### Long Term (6-12 months)

- Evolve to an institutional pilot with local partners.
- Define interoperability model with public services.
- Strengthen data governance and continuity policy.
- Publish impact and adoption indicators.

### Success Metrics

- Lead time for new features.
- Release quality (critical bugs per cycle).
- Multi-language feature coverage.
- Stability of key demo components.
