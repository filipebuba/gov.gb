# Governance


This document defines how decisions are made in **GOV-GB** and who participates in that process.

### Purpose

Ensure transparency, predictability, and accountability in the project's technical and institutional evolution.

### Governance Structure

- **Maintainers**: responsible for technical review, roadmap direction, and releases.
- **Contributors**: collaborators submitting improvements via Pull Requests.
- **Stakeholders**: institutional partners contributing priorities and requirements.

### Decision-Making Process

1. Open proposal through an issue or Pull Request.
2. Technical and impact discussion.
3. Review by at least 1 maintainer.
4. Approval and merge following quality criteria.

For significant architectural changes, include a short technical proposal in the PR (context, alternatives, and trade-offs).

### Participation Rules

- Mutual respect and clear communication.
- Constructive feedback grounded in evidence.
- Technical decisions guided by public impact, security, and sustainability.

### Transparency

- Important decisions should be documented in issues/PRs.
- Scope changes should be reflected in `ROADMAP.md`.
- Policies and processes should remain accessible in this repository.
